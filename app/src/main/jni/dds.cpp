/* 
   DDS 2.7.0   A bridge double dummy solver.
   Copyright (C) 2006-2014 by Bo Haglund   
   Cleanups and porting to Linux and MacOSX (C) 2006 by Alex Martelli.
   The code for calculation of par score / contracts is based upon the
   perl code written by Matthew Kidd for ACBLmerge. He has kindly given
   permission to include a C++ adaptation in DDS.
   						
   The PlayAnalyser analyses the played cards of the deal and presents 
   their double dummy values. The par calculation function DealerPar 
   provides an alternative way of calculating and presenting par 
   results.  Both these functions have been written by Soren Hein.
   He has also made numerous contributions to the code, especially in 
   the initialization part.

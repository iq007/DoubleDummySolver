/* 
   This object, Timer, was was written by Søren Hein.
  Many thanks for allowing me to include it in DDS.
 

 It is a simple object for timing functions or code pieces.

   As it stands, it is somewhat specific to AB searches,

   but it can of course be generalized.
*/



/* 
   There are groups of 50 timers.
  Each group corresponds to
 something that should be timed at multiple AB depths, i.e.

   cards played.  The first card of a new game is number 48,

   and the last card is number 0.
   The AB timer is special, as the AB functions are recursive

   and so their timing includes not only the other functions they

   contain, but also their own recursive calls at lower depths.

   The AB timer group must be the first one.


   The object calculates an approximation to exclusive function

   times, so it is a "poor man's profiler".
  For AB, first the
 times at depth-1 are subtracted out, and then the times for

   all calls at the same depth are subtracted out.  This still

   leaves the overhead of the timing itself.  As an approximation,

   there is one timing overhead left for each function, and it

   is on the order of the execution time of Evaluate(), which is

   a very fast function. */
